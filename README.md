## Features
- The website is responsive on all device sizes.











<>index.html

The main page and Contact.html are the only pages in operation, the others are just blank pages, the pages were created so that there were no broken links. I tried to make the site as responsive as possible within my knowledge and research.
- The site is available for 7 different sizes of screens, from cell phones to larger screens such as a full HD TV.
- The site has enough large and colorful images to catch the user's attention, most of the descriptions only appear when the mouse is over the images.

LOGO

![alt text](https://github.com/KrouTm/Japan-s-Magic/blob/main/README.images/logo.PNG?raw=true)

- The logo is quite simple, how you can see it, if I had more time I would have designed something myself just to simulate something more realistic as a real logo would look like. But for now, I just wrote the name of the site with a red circle representing the flag of Japan.

NAVBAR

![alt text](https://github.com/KrouTm/Japan-s-Magic/blob/main/README.images/navbar.PNG?raw=true)

![alt text](https://github.com/KrouTm/Japan-s-Magic/blob/main/README.images/navbarmobile0.PNG?raw=true)

- The navbar is fixed at the top so that the user always has access to it even at the bottom of the page, so the user doesn't need to go back to the top of the page to access another page available in the navbar.
- The navbar is responsive so that users of smaller screens do not have difficulties using it, when the screen is smaller than 1024px, the navbar format changes, and the bar options become horizontal, so the options are more readable.

EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW & BACKGROUND IMAGE

![alt text](https://github.com/KrouTm/Japan-s-Magic/blob/main/README.images/every.PNG?raw=true)

- I wanted to put an inviting phrase that brings confidence to the user while expressing what the site is about, a site where people can get information about the place.
- The entrance to the site is simple, delicate and all the elements in the navbar or phrases that needed to be placed are simple and transparent so as not to distract from the beauty that the image of the place brings.
- The intention was for the user not to feel lost or frustrated with many elements on the screen.

CULTURE

![alt text](https://github.com/KrouTm/Japan-s-Magic/blob/main/README.images/culture.PNG?raw=true)
![alt text](https://github.com/KrouTm/Japan-s-Magic/blob/main/README.images/culturemobile.PNG?raw=true)


- In this part of the site, I describe a little about the essence of Japanese culture and the user can also have more information when clicking on the link.
- When the user's screen is smaller than 768px, the appearance in this part changes a little, the image before that was on the side of the description, becomes behind because there is no space to put it to the side, leaving the look strange and uncomfortable for the read.
- Before, I had taken the image but I don't like it and I decided to improve it.

PLACE, RESTAURANT & NIGHTLIFE

![alt text](https://github.com/KrouTm/Japan-s-Magic/blob/main/README.images/place.PNG?raw=true)
![alt text](https://github.com/KrouTm/Japan-s-Magic/blob/main/README.images/placemobible.PNG?raw=true)


- This is the part where the user looks for information about his trip to Japan, to provide information on restaurants, bars, and tourist attractions.
- When used on cell phones or tablets with 320px - 768px resolution, the images of Place, Restaurant, and Night Life is placed on top of each other, so the image and description are not too small to spoil the user experience in receiving the information.
- The descriptions of the images appear only when the mouse is hovered over the images, so the user can feel the interaction with the site.

BEST TIME TO GO

![alt text](https://github.com/KrouTm/Japan-s-Magic/blob/main/README.images/besttimetogo.PNG?raw=true)

- As the name says, in this part of the site the user must access the link and understand that each time of year has an advantage and will be guided to the available options of the time.
- There's not much hype here, just three different stations splitting the space evenly on the screen for a prettier look, couldn't think of a better way to represent that.

WHO ARE US?

![alt text](https://github.com/KrouTm/Japan-s-Magic/blob/main/README.images/who.PNG?raw=true)
![alt text](https://github.com/KrouTm/Japan-s-Magic/blob/main/README.images/whomobile.PNG?raw=true)

- The user needs to acquire confidence, so in this part, I left a beautiful natural image of Japan, when the mouse hovers over the phrase "Who are us?", the user can read the description of us and what we are willing to offer.
- To make this more readable on cell phones or tablets, I removed the margin of the .card so that it could take up more space on the screen.

<>Contact.html

![alt text](https://github.com/KrouTm/Japan-s-Magic/blob/main/README.images/contact.PNG?raw=true)
![alt text](https://github.com/KrouTm/Japan-s-Magic/blob/main/README.images/contactmobile.PNG?raw=true)

The contact part is pretty straightforward and I wish I had worked on it more with more time available.
The appearance in this part of the site before being changed was different, confusing, and not straightforward, that's what I had managed to do at the time, but I changed the way the items behave and I didn't have to do an extensive media query like in the <> index.css.
All the links in this part are directed to a single page just so there are no broken links because obviously, the site does not exist, so of course, there is no email called JapansMagic@ or the site's phone number or even an address, they are just to represent what it would be like if it had.

BUGS & ADJUSTMENT

1. Before the navbar was only responsive and for large screens, but now for screens smaller than 768px, it changes to an icon with three horizontal bars that the user can click on and see the navbar link options.

2. Previously, a 4k background video was used, but when the site was opened on a screen that was not 4K, the video did not adjust to the size of the screen (it was still the size that it is) and this left a strange look for the site, as it only showed a piece of the video on the screen. I couldn't make it responsive and make the video shrink or enlarge. I tried to edit Adobe Premiere for the Full HD size, but when it came to a 4k screen, it just didn't fit the screen size, getting too small.

3. In the Culture part before it was just an image with border-radius: 50%; pretty boring, it also didn't fit very well on large or small screens, now I've completely changed the look. On screens larger than 768px, the image is next to the description, so I didn't want to put a huge description about Japanese culture right on the first page, it's just an inviting text to arouse curiosity and click on the link and learn more about it, so on large screens, the image needs to take up space. On smaller screens, it was necessary to "save space", so I relocated the image to the background of the description, so I wouldn't have to remove the image from the screen.

4. Another problem was with the part that I called "Place, Restaurant & Nightlife" before it was hard to make it visually not weird on smaller screens like tablets and cellars, I was putting a lot of changes in the media query and it wasn't getting good, but after having had more time to improve this, I left on the larger screens display: flex; for those smaller than 768px display: inline-block; so the images could overlap and could be bigger, I also declared the height: 30rem; width: 80%; (the width needed to be 80% so I could put a margin between the images) margin: 20px; finally, setting the width to % the width of the image would adjust to the smallest screen size proportionally.

5. Before the "Place, Restaurant & Nightlife" images, there was no description, it was just an image with a background image. This was making the site look incomplete as if it had yet to be written, but now the images have descriptions.

6. In the "Who are us?" on smaller screens the .card element was too small and the text in it too, on larger screens I put .card{width:50%; height:80%; margin:10%; margin-top: 5vh; transition: all 2s;}, but on the smaller ones I decided to fill the entire image with this, looking like this .card{width:100%; height:100%; margin: auto}, so it would have more space and be visually more comfortable to read on small screens.

7. In Contact.html I had a lot of messy and unresponsive elements. Now I solved the problem in a very simple way by placing practically all the elements centered so that they fit in the center according to the size of the screen. Only Footer has the display: inline-block; therefore, he and the elements in it will overlap when the margin decreases enough for that. the only modification i had to make in media querie was:
@media (min-width:320px) and (max-width:480px){    
    /*Contact*/
    .font-contact{font-size:3em;}
    .p-social{font-size:2em;}
    .social{padding-right: 0.5rem; padding-left: 0.5rem;}
    .p-sign{padding:1em; width:20rem;}
    }
&
@media (min-width:481px) and (max-width:768px){     
    /*Contact*/
    .p-sign{width:30rem;}
    }
